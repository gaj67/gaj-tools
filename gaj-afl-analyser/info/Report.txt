3.x The Classifier

3.y Handling Draws

The classifier model discussed in Section 3.x is designed to predict the probability of a win for team x over team y, 
given that ordering of the two teams. Thus, if p = P(win[x]|x,y,e) > 0.5, then the prediction is that team x will win, and if 
p < 0.5, then it is predicted that team y will win. However, what happens when p = 0.5?

Also, for each match in the sample data, an error score of 0 may be assigned if the predicted team won, 
and an error score of 1 assigned if the predicted team lost. The error rate of the classifier on the sample data is then
the average of the individual error scores. However, what error score should be assigned for a draw?
 
In order to investigate the handling of draws, let the proportions of wins, losses and draws for team x in the sample set be 
w, ell and d, respectively, such that w+ell+d = 1.
Now, in principle a draw may be considered as both a partial win and a partial loss for both teams. So, let us assign a proportion
lambda of draws as wins to team x and losses to team y, and the remaining proportion (1-lambda) of draws as losses to
team x and wins to team y. Hence, under a model that always predicts team x to win, the error rate will be
ell+(1-lambda)d, and under a model that always predicts team y to win, the error rate will be w+lambda d.
The unbiased average of these extremes then gives a baseline error rate of

0.5[ell+(1-lambda)d]+0.5[w+lambda d] = 0.5[w+ell+d] = 0.5 .

In other words, if the classifier cannot clearly predict a winner for any given match, i.e. p approx. 0.5, then an error
score of 0.5 should be assigned to that match, regardless of the actual outcome. 

For matches where a prediction is clear, we still have to deal with how to score a drawn outcome. However, the above reasoning still holds. 
Thus, for a model that always predicts team x to win, a proportion (1-lambda)d of draws are assigned as losses to x, 
and for a model that always predicts team y to win, a proportion lambda d of draws are assigned as losses to y. The unbiased average of these
extremes then gives a baseline error rate for drawn matches of

(0.5[(1-lambda)d]+0.5[lambda d]) / d = 0.5. 

Thus, the predicted winning team should be given an error score of 0.5 for a drawn match. Note that the use of an unbiased average is based
on the fact that the classifier model of Section 3.x allows the order of teams x and y to be switched without affecting the probabilities
that team x or team y will win (only the ordering of these probabilities will change).


4. Environmental Factors

4.1 Home-ground Advantage

In many sports, the team playing on its home ground has a slight advantage over the team playing away.
This can be understood in two ways. Firstly, the away-team has the stress and fatigue of travelling to a distant
venue, which the home-team does not have to suffer (at least as much). Secondly, the home-team can be expected to
know its own ground better (e.g. the size of the oval, the hardness of the surface, etc.), 
and to therefore be both more relaxed and more able playing on it. 

In order to test the strength of any home-ground advantage, the non-finals rounds of football from the 2008 and 2009 seasons
were analysed. The home-team was chosen as specified in the data, and a win by the home-team scored 1, a loss scored 0, and
a draw scored 0.5. The results showed that the average proportion of wins by the home-team was 0.57, with an 
approximate\footnote{Assuming a Normal distribution and two standard deviations} confidence interval of $[0.53,0.60]$.
Since this interval does not contain the null-hypothesis mean of 0.5, it is concluded that there is a small but statistically 
significant advantage to the home-team. 

Unfortunately, the assumption of knowing the home-team is slightly too simplistic. It turns out that each team is designated
as playing at home or away based upon pre-determined allocations in each round. 
Thus, for example, Port Power might be designated as having a home game against the Adelaide Crows at AAMI Stadium. 
However, AAMI Stadium is also the home ground of the Crows, and so neither team can be said to enjoy the home-ground advantage in such 
derby matches. In fact, over the 2008 and 2009 non-finals seasons, the Crows won or drew an average of 50% of their games against 
the Power (and vice versa), according to the aforementioned scoring system. Furthermore, the approximate confidence interval
of $[0.15,0.85]$ indicates that such derbies are fiercely contested, with highly variable outcomes, and so, statistically, no significant
home-team advantage can be assigned to either the Adelaide Crows or Port Power.

The way out of this dilemma is to assign both the home-team and the away-team an advantage measure 
based upon the ground at which each team plays its home matches.
Note that this assignment is complicated by the fact that some teams have more than one 'home' ground. 
As a result, upon taking the data-designated 
home-team indicator as the truth, the various teams were found to have played the following proportions of their home games 
at the following venues:

	Adelaide			  & AAMI Stadium (1.00)\\
	Brisbane Lions   & Gabba (1.00)\\
   Carlton          & Etihad Stadium (0.55)\
                    & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.41)\\
                    & Gold Coast Stadium (0.05)\\
   Collingwood      & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.82)\\
                    & Etihad Stadium (0.18)\\
	Essendon         & Etihad Stadium (0.64)\\
	                 & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.36)\\
	Fremantle        & Subiaco Oval (1.00)\\
   Geelong          & Skilled Stadium (0.73)\\
                    & Etihad Stadium (0.18)\\
                    & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.09)\\
   Hawthorn         & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.64)\\
                    & Aurora Stadium (0.36)\\
   Melbourne        & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.91)\\
                    & Manuka Oval (0.09)\\
   North Melbourne  & Etihad Stadium (0.73)\\
                    & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.14)\\
                    & Gold Coast Stadium (0.14)\\
	Port Adelaide    & AAMI Stadium (1.00)\\
	Richmond         & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.73)\\
						  & Etihad Stadium (0.23)\\
	                 & Gold Coast Stadium (0.05)\\ 
	St Kilda         & Etihad Stadium (0.95)\\
						  & Gold Coast Stadium (0.05)\\
	Sydney           & Sydney Cricket Ground (0.64)\\
	                 & ANZ Stadium (0.36)\\
	West Coast       & Subiaco Oval (1.00)\\
	Western Bulldogs & Etihad Stadium (0.73)\\
						  & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.09)\\
						  & TIO Stadium=0.09\\
						  & Manuka Oval (0.09)\\
						  
In order to test these assignments of home-ground advantage, a simple logistic classifier was trained on the 2008 and 2009 pre-finals seasons
data, using a single feature consisting of the assigned advantage of the (data-designated) home-team minus the advantage of the away-team.
Leave-one-out cross-validation then revealed an average error-rate of 0.435, with an approximate confidence interval of $[0.384,0.486]$.
Next, in order to try to detect spurious home-ground assignments, infrequent home-grounds (i.e. those with proportions less than 0.10) 
were removed, and the remaining advantage measures were renormalised. Upon retraining the classifier, 
leave-one-out cross-validation gave an average error-rate of 0.438, with an approximate confidence interval of $[0.387,0.489]$.
The slight increase in the average error-rate is clearly not significant, since the new estimate remains inside the original confidence
interval. Hence, the new proportions are taken to be:

	Adelaide			  & AAMI Stadium (1.00)\\
	Brisbane Lions   & Gabba (1.00)\\
   Carlton          & Etihad Stadium (0.57)\
                    & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.43)\\
   Collingwood      & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.82)\\
                    & Etihad Stadium (0.18)\\
	Essendon         & Etihad Stadium (0.64)\\
	                 & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.36)\\
	Fremantle        & Subiaco Oval (1.00)\\
   Geelong          & Skilled Stadium (0.80)\\
                    & Etihad Stadium (0.20)\\
   Hawthorn         & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.64)\\
                    & Aurora Stadium (0.36)\\
   Melbourne        & Melbourne Cricket Ground (1.00)\\
   North Melbourne  & Etihad Stadium (0.73)\\
                    & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.14)\\
                    & Gold Coast Stadium (0.14)\\
	Port Adelaide    & AAMI Stadium (1.00)\\
	Richmond         & Melbourne Cricket Ground (0.76)\\
						  & Etihad Stadium (0.24)\\
	St Kilda         & Etihad Stadium (1.00)\\
	Sydney           & Sydney Cricket Ground (0.64)\\
	                 & ANZ Stadium (0.36)\\
	West Coast       & Subiaco Oval (1.00)\\
	Western Bulldogs & Etihad Stadium (1.00)\\
